The Collatz Conjecture (also called the "3n + 1" problem) states that given any positive integer, a sequence of operations will eventually converge to the number 1. The two operations are given by: if an integer is even, the next number in the sequence is half of the original. If it is odd, the next number is one more than 3 times the original number. It is a famously unsolved problem, with computers checking numbers with starting values up to around 2.95 * 10^20, or 2^68. In layman's terms, the conjecture seems to hold for all positive integers. 

A basic way to obtain the sequence a starting value generates is to directly program the rules, which was the original approach to programming this function. The test data set used is a set unsorted list of 50000 randomly generated and unique integers ranging from 1-100000. Over 10 trials on the same unaltered set, the na√Øve implementation took on average 975 ms (.975 seconds), which time aside, is a starting benchmark for optimization/improvements.
